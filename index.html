        <p class="info"> <strong>
            Paranormal Activity is a 2007 American supernatural horror film produced, written, directed, photographed
            and edited by Oren Peli. It centers on a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are haunted by
            a supernatural presence in their home. They then set up a camera to document what is haunting them. The film
            utilizes found-footage conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series.

            Originally developed as an independent feature and given film festival screenings in 2007, the film was shot
            for $15,000. It was then acquired by Paramount Pictures and modified, particularly with a new ending that
            cost an additional total of $200,000. It was given a limited U.S. release on September 25, 2009, and then a
            nationwide release on October 16, 2009. The film earned nearly $108 million at the U.S. box office and a
            further $85 million internationally for a worldwide total of $193 million. Paramount/DreamWorks acquired
            the U.S. rights for $350,000. It is the most profitable film ever made, based on return on
            investment, although such figures are difficult to verify independently as this is likely to
            exclude marketing costs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity">For more info click here.</strong></a>

<!--So what I did to fix the problem was to put the footer after the end of the code body and as you can se the footer has a <p> code inside which I didn't put at the beggining. If you put the text as paragraph that should work and one more thing that I add was to use <br> to move the footer more down but I use does before my </main> or </body> ending. I hope that works for you-->
